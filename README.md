![Planfix API Library](PLANFIX.svg)

**go-planfix** is a Rest API for [Planfix.com](http://planfix.com). You can manage
your application with this library. It contains multiple
API requests Planfix provides with support of CRUD operations.

## Quick Start / Installation

To get started with **go-planfix**, you'll need to do the following:

- Install the latest version of Go.
- Install the **go-planfix** package using go get.
- Use the **go-planfix** package in your Go code.
- Here's an example of how to install the package:

```

```

## Models

**go-planfix** includes a package for working with models, which allows you to use just the API and **create your own models**.
This means you can create your own structs and use them with our **go-planfix** package,
even if you don't want to use every field from Planfix's entities.

Here's the link to [Models](https://github.com/whatcrm/go-planfix/models) package and example of how to install the package.

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-planfix/models
